# figure8task

A microtask system that is managed by the community

Based upon a library of tasks maintained in an open wiki, users can claim tasks, be approved by the tasks' owner and then be compensated for their work after it is finished (or donate the compensation).  

Task types:
* location independant
* location-based
* repeating
* collaborative
* synergistic/time-sensitive

examples:

| Location independant | Location-based | repeating | collaborative | synergistic/time-sensitive
